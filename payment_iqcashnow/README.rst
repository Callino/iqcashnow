The following modules does depend on this module

- pos_iqcashnow (POS integration for crypto currency)
- website_iqcashnow (E-Commerce integration, offer crypto currency payments for your customers)

IQCashnow takes over the entire process handling, and is available in the SEPA region.

The amount paid by the customer can be immediately converted into the selected target currency to avoid any exchange rate risks.

Payment is made weekly or monthly to the merchant's bank account or wallet in the chosen currency.

You even won't need a wallet for this, just a normal bank account for the out payments is needed.
