This is a technical base module which does provide the basic functions and data for the IQ Cashnow Modules

The following modules does depend on this module

- pos_iqcashnow (POS integration for crypto currency)
- website_iqcashnow (E-Commerce integration, offer crypto currency payments for your customers)
- invoice_iqcashnow (Your invoices can get paid using crypto currency) <- Will arrive soon

IQCashnow takes over the entire process handling, and is available in the SEPA region.

The amount paid by the customer can be immediately converted into the selected target currency to avoid any exchange rate risks.

Payment is made weekly or monthly to the merchant's bank account or wallet in the chosen currency.

You even won't need a wallet for this, just a normal bank account for the out payments is needed.

With IQCashnow you can accept (more to come):
 * Bitcoin
 * Dash
