This is the module which does provide the E-commerce integration for the IQ Cashnow Modules

IQCashnow takes over the entire process handling, and is available in the SEPA region.

The amount paid by the customer can be immediately converted into the selected target currency to avoid any exchange rate risks.

Payment is made weekly or monthly to the merchant's bank account or wallet in the chosen currency.

You even won't need a wallet for this, just a normal bank account for the out payments is needed.

With IQCashnow you can accept the following crytpo currencies in your webshop (more to come):
 * Bitcoin
 * Dash
